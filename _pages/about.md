More than ten years of experience in AI platform, large-scale Internet recommendation and search system architecture design and development. My field of work involves devops, mlops, machine learning platform, recommendation system and other data-driven system architecture.

Long-term focus on product and technology in the field of AI engineering.

highlight
======
* I have extensive experience in AI platform and AI-driven application systems (recommendation/search, etc.) in architecture design and development. I have a deep understanding and practical experience in the field of AI engineering, including data center AI, LLM AI, and edge AI.
* I have rich experience in product design, development, and team management. During my time at The 4Paradigm, I led a team to design and develop core products such as the machine learning platform (Prophet/AIOS), automated machine learning platform (HyperCycle), and intelligent recommendation system platform (CESS) from scratch.
* I have led the design and development of the AI Full-scenario flow orchestration and scheduling framework——FlowEngine. This framework is widely used in decision-making AI projects at The 4Paradigm and is now open-source and operated by myself (http://flow-engine.github.io).
* I have a comprehensive technical skill set and a good grasp of mainstream technologies in big data, cloud-native, and machine learning, with a strong awareness of industry trends.
* I have a certain level of industry influence, participating in numerous industry sharing and communication activities. I have contributed to the co-authoring of "MLOps Engineering Practices" and run an independent media account called "AI Engineering".
* I have a certain understanding of enterprise operations, covering the entire process from pre-sales to development and delivery. I have experience in building teams from scratch and incubating business units.
